                        <h4>My name is Matt Stevenson, I'm twenty years old and I'm a third year student at the Ulster University, Coleraine.
                            Currently, I'm out of Uni and on a one year placement - where I work and study in 'ISArc',
                            a Software Development company who have taken on three voluntary placement students, including myself.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            This Website has been created with regards to a Level 3 Certificate in Web Design and Development (RQF), that I wish to obtain whilst here at ISArc.
                            During the course of a 6-8 week period, I will further develop this site to be a Log Entry site that can not only allow me to post up-to-date logs to my learning
                                                    but allow them to be viewed collectively, be edited and for Feedback to be sent me via email.

                <br>
                <div class="scroll"><h6>Today is Thursday the 8th of September, thus far the other placement students and I have been imaging our MacBook Pro’s, downloading and installing programs relating to
                    the work we will be doing over the course of the year.

    Today, Alan has tasked us with ‘HTML & CSS 1’, which asks us to “Make a webpage in a folder on your desktop using a text editor”. To begin with I have installed ‘PhpStorm’,
                    a commercial IDE for HTML, PHP and JavaScript. Using PhpStorm I created a New Project with a blank .html file called ‘index’, giving the document a ‘document type’ of ‘html’,
                    this informs the browser used to load the page what type of file is being loaded. I then added a structure to the document, using ‘html’, ‘head’ and ‘body’ tags, these tags allow
                    for a basic page layout and form the building blocks required to create the rest of the webpage.
                    <br>
                    <br>
    From here I reverted back to my guidelines in which I’m asked to add several elements to the webpage, one of which was to include my name as a ‘header’. A header in html
                    is an element that offers a selection of text sizes to chose from, I used the ‘h1’ header tag although there are header tags h1 through to h6, h1 being the largest and h6
                    being the smallest. For my introductory paragraph I used ‘p’ tags to create the paragraph, the paragraph element differs from that of the header elements as it is used when
                    writing main body text that can be orientated by style sheets within the webpage, I set this element to ‘fixed-width’, so that it does not change no matter the size of the users
                    display. For the creation of a table within the webpage we have used ‘table’ tags with ‘tr’ tags for table rows, ‘th’ tags for table headings and ‘td’ for table data/contents,
                                                                                                                                                                               I set this element to ‘fluid’, which allows the table to resize itself depending on the size of the users display. Creating a hyperlink for ‘W3 Schools’ was rather simple in that
                    using an ‘anchor’ tag ‘a’ and referencing a desired URL within quotations creates the hyperlink, then any text included will redirect the user to the destination upon clicking it.
                    <br>
                    <br>
    In terms of CSS, I included a set of ‘style’ tags in the ‘head’ section of my HTML document, within these tags I have edited the webpage’s paragraph text using ‘font-family’ -
    set to Arial and ‘font-size’ to ‘22px’, ‘padding-left’ set to ‘50px’ which pads the paragraph text 50 pixels from the left margin of the page, I also set ‘colour’ to white. For
                    headings ‘h2’ and ‘h3’ I set font to Arial and padding-left to ’10px’ and ‘20px’ respectively, with colour set to ‘ghostwhite’, for the ‘body’ of the document I set ‘background-colour’
                    to ‘grey’ - these colour names are preloaded into HTML and CSS and I did not use a Hexadecimal colour code to set them.
                    <br>
                    <br>
    I used ‘Quicktime Player’ to create a new voice recording and record myself speaking aloud “Welcome to my Placement Log”. By default the file was saved as a ‘.m4a’ audio file,
                    something we weren't interested in as the assessment criteria asks that we include both a ‘.mp3’ file and a ‘.ogg’ file, having taken this into consideration I converted the file
                    to the appropriate file formats using a online converter and saved them to my Projects folder. To create the audio player I used ‘audio’ tags, using the ‘controls’ attribute to add
                    audio controls such as play and pause, embedded in the audio tags I referenced each audio file with sources ‘src’ and assigning them a ‘type’ of ‘/ogg’ and ‘/mpeg’ respectively.
                    To view my webpage in a browser format I’m using ‘localhost’, an HTML 5 API.

                <br>
                <h6>Having completed HTML & CSS 1 with reasonable ease, we moved on to HTML & CSS 2. In this section I concentrated a lot more on the CSS of the webpage,
                    the first task was to apply a font change in CSS to an HTML element, I did this by firstly linking my style sheet to the html document in the ‘head’ section then using
                    ‘font-family’ and ‘font-size’ and set them to ‘Arial’ and ‘20px’ respectively. I then emboldened some text in this paragraph using ‘b’ tags, I added a background colour
                    to some of the text using ‘background-colour’ in CSS set to ‘yellow’, as well as a rounded border to a title in CSS setting it to ‘3px’, its style to ‘solid’ and the colour
                    to ‘red’, and finally setting ‘border-radius’ to ‘10px’ to create the rounded corners. Next up I created a ‘hover’ property and a transition effect on an image to make it
                    scale up to 110% of its original size. We we’re asked to create a transition effect of rotate and rotate Y, which we did originally but I removed this feature as it isn’t a
                    very appropriate transition for my webpage. We also created an overlay of position absolute and an unordered list with ‘li’ elements embedded within it with ‘button’ tags to
                    create a list of buttons.

                <br>
                <h6>In this exercise we experimented with a GUI and uploaded changes made within the GUI to a web server, we used BlueGriffon. Firstly, I entered a header to the page and changed
                    the font to Arial and the size to 24, I then added another table to the page with no contents. We uploaded our edits to the W3 schools validator to validate our projects and check
                    for errors and discrepancies in the code. Finally we uploaded out altered webpage to Git Hub, using the command line to add, commit and push the new page to our Git repositories.
    GUI HTML editors are often evaluated against that of the W3C Accessibility Guidelines, a series of guidelines which ask questions about GUI systems in order to determine if they are
                    more or less accessible to users, for example - The GUI editor BlueGriffon allows us to edit the size and font of text on a page, this is a degree of accessibility that is present within
                    the editor - that is also stated within the WSC’s guidelines.

                <div class="scroll"><h6>
    Today we studied a multitude of topics relating to ‘Internet Architecture’, Internet Architecture is a term defining a vast number of networks interconnecting and
    communicating with a common protocol. So what is a Client Server Network? A Client Server Network is a centralised network connected to a high performance machine,
                    called a ‘server’, the CSN acts as a ‘hub’ or focal point for other smaller and less powerful machines or nodes. A Client has certain requirements before it can operate,
                    one main essential is that it has a computer or other device to connect to, this device must contain a network card or be capable of connecting to a modem. A router is also
                    required for Client connectivity, many modern routers have a modem built into them, a browser is also a necessity.<br>
                    <br>

                    Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) is a systematic telephone exchange which operates on an international scale, it transmits analogue voice data and signals using copper wires.

    Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) is a set of standards for communication and transmission of data such as audio and video, ISDN operates on top of the PSDN.

    Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) is in referral to a ‘modem’ something very common in most homes of the modern age, a DSL modem can be connected to a router and a broadband telephone
                    line in order to allow a computer or other device to access Internet services.

    Internet Protocol (IP) is a protocol which allows for both sending and receiving data packets over the Internet, the protocol defines a format for data sent and received along with
                    deciding upon a method by which data is to be sent.

    Open Systems Interconnection Model (OSI Model) is a conceptual model with 7 main layers, it characterises how applications can communicate over a network, allowing software programs
                    to operate together.

    Remote Access Protocols and Services (RAP) are what allows a computer node with use of Point-to-point client software to connect to a host computer, often from a remote location - this is
                    called a Remote Access Server. Point-to-point (PPP) is a protocol which establishes a direct link between two machines, often simply one node connected to a server. PPPoE or Point-to-point over
                    Ethernet is a network specification for establishing a connection between one or more computer nodes over a local area network to a remote location or site, the PPP protocol frameset is said to be
                    ‘encapsulated’ within the frames of the Ethernet frame - my understanding of this is that PPP allows a direct connection between two nodes, and the Ethernet specification which allows multiple users/nodes
                    to connect in a LAN connection.


    Ajax (JavaScript) is a script that allows communication between the client and a server without the need for a complete refresh of the page.
    Point of Presence (POP) is an access point or interface point in which multiple networks connect to each other, often referring to a location or facility that allows nodes to connect
                    to the Internet.<br>
                    <br>

    Internet eXchange Point (IXP) is a network infrastructure that allows ISP’s to exchange internet traffic, there are a very limited amount of them in the world.

    Domain Name Systems (DNS) is a naming system for computers or other devices with Internet connectivity, it looks up addresses using a naming structure of a prefix, subdomain, domain
                    name and an extension. ‘.com’ and the likes are top level domain names, ‘.co.uk' is a second level domain name.

                    Shared Domains are alterations of the subdomains part of an address, allowing separate parts of a server to be accessed using domain registrars e.g. https://finance.nowthis.tech.

                    Cloud Computing is a form of storing and processing data over the Internet without the use of a local server, instead, a variation of remote servers are used to host the network
                    and allow access from remote locations, it’s use is often associated with improved disaster recovery. One downside to Cloud computing is that a user must have Internet connectivity
                    in order to use it.

                    Rich Site Summary (RSS) also known as ‘Really Simple Syndication’ is content delivery method for blogs on the Internet, when content is distributed it is called an RSS feed.

                    whereabouts can be shared with other people and devices.

                    Mobile Computing is a wireless technology that allows the transmission of data and information with no physical connection to a server or network, data such as audio and video
                    can be shared from mobile to phones to remote locations around the world with use of the Internet.

                    Conversion Voice to Text is a complex technology which allows voice input to be converted to textual data on a computer, to be sent to a recipient.

                    Social Media is omnipresent in todays society and a lot of people around the world rely on it as a form of communication and marketing, having said this the forms of social
                    media available to us do not follow the exact same format when considering the content that they allow to be shared. For example, Twitter requires short, concise messages which are usually
                    posted with regards to general communication between friends or associates, whereas Youtube is one that requires planned and refined media production in the form of videos.

                    Blogs (RSS) are webpages that are updated on a regular basis with new content and information often used for the means of discussion or conversation between a group of registered users.
                    Blogs can be linked using an RSS feed.

                    Folksonomies are a means of searching a data store using textual properties, such as a hashtag - used by Twitter and Instagram to allow users to refine their news feeds with material
                    they may be interested in. A hashtag is used in order to link users with similar posts and can be searched on the site, a folksonomy is a hashtag that has been created by a user and usually has
                    little or no baring to anything else on the site, unlike common hashtag categories. It seems odd to think about the extreme lack of current legislation regarding the dictation of what we can and
                    can’t do whilst we’re online, the severe lack is partly down to the fact in the past it has taken years, maybe even decades to ‘pass’ valid legislation through government systems - a slow and what
                    seems to be delicate process for the passing of legislation regarding our online conduct. Having said this, there are many organisations with a strong presence online which provide their own ‘ethical
                    conduct’ which is the description of monitoring what happens online, without there being any existing legislation to accompany the concept - take Twitter or YouTube’s verification of user accounts as a
                    good example, Twitter can verify their users whom have a celebrity status or social following, in order to eliminate the theft of their identities or impersonation.

                <br>
                <div class="scroll"><h6>Whilst using a computer, for recreational purposes or as a profession, ensuring security and protecting our devices from the dangers of being connected to the Internet poses is absolutely vital. When using the Internet protecting our computers from counter attacks is of utmost importance, keeping PC’s up to date with the newest updates and security patches helps to fend off malicious attacks which may have been capable of doing damage to your machine otherwise. A lot of users like to utilise IDS’s - Intruder Detection Systems along with that of a built-in Firewall, an IDS is somewhat similar to a Firewall in the fact they both detect for intrusion on a network, but do it in different ways. An IDS analyses all inbound and outbound activity on a network and flags up anything that may appear to be of a malicious origin or an intrusive entity, if an intrusion attempt has been made the IDS signals to the user and notifies them of suspicious activity on the network, even if the attack has originated from within the network itself. When using a Firewall to protect against counter attacks, the Firewall will observe the networks status and upon discovering an abnormality attempting to access the network, it will attempt to stop it - the main difference here is that the Firewall will monitor network traffic and attempt to prevent security breaches as they attempt to gain unauthorised access, but using an IDS can analyse a security risk from within the network if it has already gained access or if it originated from within the network itself. Closing unused or non-essential ports on a network is also crucial in the prevention of hackers and security breaches, ports that are not being used can allow for hackers to gain access and make changes to configurations or distribute content throughout the network. If a network has been experiencing performance issues, abnormal decrease in network speed or connectivity, you may wish to inspect the network closely and attempt to diagnose if there is any unauthorised or malicious activity present on the network that may have gone unnoticed, remaining vigilant when your network is experiencing issues is essential. To ensure utmost data security when operating a functioning network in a workplace, all staff and users must be equip with the appropriate training and knowledge of the risks at hand, and of possible prevention measures that can be taken in order to relieve the system of a security breach - training in these areas will allow for better maintenance of the network and in turn decrease the volumes of stress the network will have to experience due to staff being knowledgeable of Internet and data security procedures.

                    There are a multitude of measures that can be taken to prevent counter attacks to your network, but what if you have already been attacked, or one of your prevention procedures has failed? The first thing to do in any case of an attack is to determine the type of attack that has been posed to the network, along with its location - this can be done in a multitude of ways but if the devices IP address is available, it can be used to pinpoint the attackers location and the address can be blocked and blacklisted from the network. If the attack is indeed an internal attack and has spawned from within the network itself it is advised that all affected units are immediately disconnected from the network. One form of attack which is considered to be extremely detrimental to the wellbeing of a network is a DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attack, a DDoS attack describes the flooding of traffic to a network from lots of different devices, this usually occurs when a host computer has been infected with some kind of malicious virus - often a Trojan, which allows a hacker or suspect behind the attack to control the traffic flow to the targeted system. The reasoning for a DDoS attack and not simply a DoS attack is that a DoS attack is essentially the same but the traffic comes from only one device, allowing blocking the IP address of the computer to be an effective means in which to stop the attack at its source, in a DDoS attack as mentioned the traffic pours in from many different sources, often in the hundreds or possibly thousands of PC’s in different locations are all requesting from the network, clogging it with traffic. A DDoS attack is very difficult to stop as it is extremely difficult to distinguish legitimate network traffic from malicious traffic inbound to the network - in the case of a DDoS attack you must contact your Internet Service Provider (ISP) immediately for further instruction and assistance. When the attack has been blocked or interrupted a direct backup of all significant data should be made urgently, along with diagnostics being undertaken in the manner of finding the attacks source, type and intention to further prevent future attacks of the same description. If any data was affected during the attack, lost, stolen or data altered in any way it must be noted and possibly quarantined within the system - any backups that have been made in recent times should be used to reconstruct the system if damage has been caused. A routine should be in order to reinstall operating systems on affected devices, but it also seen as good practice to reinstall OS on devices which have not been affected, even if there has been no attack. Stakeholders that have significant baring to the company or the relevant system that has been affected should be contacted and informed of the incident as soon as possible to allow them to make important decisions regarding their involvement or to initiate an appropriate solution to the problem.

                    What is Social Engineering? What are the risks it poses to our security, and how can we combat it in the most appropriate possible manner? Well, the term ‘social engineering’ is simply defining the act of manipulating a person or group of people in order to gain access to confidential information. A ‘social engineer’ is someone who intentional attempts to deceive someone into giving up their personal information, often passwords, bank details or for access to a device or network with intent to distribute malicious software - to then carry out criminal activity. Social engineering attacks can be directed in many different ways, you may be asked for information that is confidential, or only being available to certain authorised users - if the person requesting this information is unknown to you, or seems to be posing as someone else, do ensure not to make any contact with them. Social engineering attacks often take the form of someone attempting to gain information about a person or a business, in order to prove legitimacy when contacting others to gain access to a body of information, ensuring you keep your wits about you and deter from responding to the likes of suspicious emails known as ‘phishing’ is a good way in which to avoid your information falling into the wrong hands.

                    So, how exactly can we prevent social engineering? In the case of someone making a request to access information which has been made confidential and not available to the general public, they must be identified. Identifying someone who aims to carry out a socially engineered attack is of utmost importance, as anyone who can be identified can be flagged and be blocked from future contact. When users of a system are dealing with unidentified requests from a suspicious origin, they must always follow security procedures and be trained to be knowledgable of criminal ongoings, along with how to identify possible attacks. If you have been contacted via telephone, persons or businesses often call back the source  from a customer service line, in order to confirm the legitimacy of the call - if you are unsure about something regarding your personal information or the information that is being hosted on a network by your business, do always make sure to attempt to confirm its legitimacy. In the case of someone contacting you with information specific to you, ensure to make changes to any authentication requirements such as passwords or PIN numbers to disallow any further information being leaked to unauthorised persons. If you have noticed suspicious activity on your computer or network, always make thorough checks on your anti-virus software and security logs to confirm this.

                    Symmetric Encryption is a type of encryption which uses a ‘key’ to alter text or messages when being sent over the Internet, this key is available to not only the sender but the recipient of a message as the message is ‘decrypted’ upon arrival at its destination. Asymmetric Encryption is a different manner of encryption which uses a ‘public’ key, which encrypts data before it is sent to the recipient, upon arrival it cannot be decrypted without the use of a ‘private key’ which belongs only to the person receiving the message. This way, a user can encrypt a message and send it to someone else using a public key, but it cannot be decrypted unless a specific ‘private’ key is available to the recipient. On any system or network, there must be a range of principles that implement authorisation  and access levels, firstly establishing a users identity entails the likes of passwords and security questions, user access can be implemented by establishing user roles (such as Administrator). Securing authentication with use of encryption and decryption and use of time-bound sessions that offer a specific timed window for user access. Remote Access Protocols can be used to establish a connection and govern the transmission of data packets over a network, allowing a system to be accessed remotely.

                    PKI (Public Key Infrastructure) is a range of procedures required to manage public-key encryption, it’s purpose is to ensure an appropriate transmission and transfer of network communications. PKI is required to provide a thorough authentication method, where passwords or security questions are insubstantial in terms of security. The Infrastructure consists of a ‘certification authority’ (CA), a ‘registration authority’ (RA), a ‘validation authority’ (VA) and a secure location in which encryption keys are stored. Firstly, an entity will request a certificate from the RA, the RA then registers this entity and certifies it with CA, the CA then sends the certification to the entity and sends information regarding validation to the VA - the user can then validate the entity by sending the public encryption key to VA for final confirmation.

                    BYOD (Bring Your Own Device) a policy that outlines the use of personal computers, smartphones or other devices and technologies belonging to employees within a workplace and allowing them to be connected to the businesses network and access company information and applications. The requirements for a BOYD policy are that any users willing to conform to the policy must have a software application that can manage their device and its connection to the businesses network, both employer and employees must have examined a written policy outlining the responsibilities that are at hand when committing to the policy, users must also sign an agreement - stating that they have read and understood the policy and their individual responsibilities relevant to its use.

                    MDM (Mobile Device Management) is a term defining the use and administration of mobile devices such as smartphones or tablets, ensuring that employees don’t breach company policies and is often implemented along with another third party application which has the ability to manage specific mobile devices. The life-cycle for MDM within a business entails provisioning, use, maintenance, monitoring and decommissioning of all devices involved.

                    When accessing the Internet, and using Cloud-based systems - there are a great deal of security threats that pose risk to our devices. Data breaches take place when a hacker gains access to data they are not originally authorised to have access to, sometimes resulting in catastrophic consequences due to lacking security a cloud-based system. Having authorisation on your system is important, when it breaks - it isn’t an ideal situation, cloud-based systems with crashed or broken authorisation utilities or having a systems credentials compromised can be sometimes very easily accessed from unauthorised entities and can allow for malicious activity on the system. Interfaces may be hacked along with API’s, making the way for unauthorised access. If there is a part of the system which is more vulnerable than others it may be targeted and taken advantage of, exploited to gain access. User accounts or credentials may be hijacked in order to gain access and breach security. Sometimes with use of a system and high profile information regarding a business or company, employees can be led to become malicious and desire to commit theft or other activities - from the inside, possibly providing cloud-based system details or access credentials to other groups of people with malicious intent. APT (Advanced Persistent Threat) parasite is an attack to system security that entails an unauthorised user gaining access to a system, in this case cloud-based - and remaining there for an extended period of time as an undetected threat to the system, often posing as a registered user, the aim is often to steal data and less frequently intent to damage or cause harm to existing data. In cloud computing there is always a risk of permanent data loss or system outage, data loss can occur from any range of reasons from hacking to natural disaster. DoS attacks which have been discussed previously also occur on cloud-based systems, having them crash and lose functionality for a certain period of time. If within a business there is shared technologies between several users, the dangers and risks are increased. If users of the system are do not remain focused and acknowledge the risks at hand when handling a cloud-based system, security threats that are posed against the system could become real problems due to inadequate diligence.

                    Disaster recovery is a massive part of any business with a computerised system at their fingertips, companies must constantly upgrade and making technological advances regarding possible disasters and the recovery process involved in restoring the system or parts of it after a disaster occurs. Systems must be monitored when there is ‘downtime’, alerting to causes and restoration procedures. If a system goes down due to Internet connectivity a company could have a backup in place so that the system can still function as normal, along with on-site backups of data and applications. Companies can have Offline access to backups and during an outage can make useful progress in determining an action to combat the disaster. Many business also have insurance for their cloud-based services which allow them to be compensated for disasters that may affect their systems or data on a network.

                    CPD (Continuous Data Protection) is a term used to define effective techniques used in order to deal with security breaches or disasters which may result in data loss, CPD enables companies to produce daily backups for non-essential data, which is less important and non-critical for backup. Critical data which is essential to a companies wellbeing should be continuously backed up throughout each day, CPD solution are no longer based on a backup cycle - meaning continuous backups can be made each day on the system. Data can also be backed up transactionally, meaning files can be changed and updated as they are changed. Diagnosing a problem regarding access to the Internet is sometimes no easy task, troubleshooting and attempting to identify a problem can entail going through a list of procedures in order to resolve the issue. Does the computer have TCP/IP enabled? The Internet is a TCP/IP network, it must have these capabilities enabled in order to function, without them enabled the connection will not be granted. Does the computer have an assigned IP address (IPConfig/IFConfig)? A computer attempting to connect to the Internet must have a valid IP address assigned to it, without it access is limited. Can the computer send a PING to a local router IP? Testing whether or not a computer can send a PING to a router along with a set of test data packets in order to determine the computers connectivity. Can the computer contact a DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) service to then be assigned an IP address? DHCP is the protocol which assigns computers their individual and unique IP addresses when accessing the Internet, without this capability it cannot connect to the Internet as requests made from the computer will no be answered.

                    Many people mix up two very different categories of problems that may arise when using the Internet, Client-Side and Server-Side issues. If you can’t connect to a service via your own computer, it very may well be a client-side issue, although not ruling out the possibility of it being a server-side issue. If you can connect from a remote location, and not your own computer - the issue is likely to lie with the server-side. Is the error directed from the server or the browser you are using? If the issue is deemed to be from the server, it is a server-side issue - otherwise, the problem may lie with your computers browser on the client-side. Troubleshooting ASDL (Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line) modem connectivity issues entails actions such as power-cycling the DSL modem - which means to turn the device off entirely, usually wait for a short period of time and turning it back on again to refresh it. Check the Modem to see if the DSL LED for Sync is illuminated or off, if it is illuminated or flashing the Modem is syncing data. TCP/IP check along with verification of the settings regarding it or altering settings. Check to see if the LED for LAN connectivity is illuminated.

                    Preventing system failures with simple maintenance tasks such as cleaning up your Hard Disk, defragmenting the disk to rearrange system files, optimising the disk using the Disk Optimiser which basically defragments the system more thoroughly. Using task manager to remove cached files or running applications that may be causing errors. Installing system updates and keeping the computer as up-to-date as possible to ensure the latest versions of applications are running. Simply cleaning, dusting and hoovering the computers internals. Inside a computer there are often many different components running side-by-side which can be relative to use with a network or server, the motherboard for example is the connection between all components within a computer, storage devices with high capacities allow for more data storage, optical discs and drives allow for installation of CD/DVD and assist with backups. When a computer is ‘booted’ after being off or for the first time ever, you may run in to some problems - If the computer is receiving power and not displaying to a screen, check the display cables and ensure they are not damaged and are plugged in correctly - take them out and put them back. If the computer is ‘beeping’ upon start-up the issue could be with the manufacturer BIOS or RAM within the computer. If you can access recovery mode, use it and attempt to recover the computers functioning state.  Why do we need to partition and format our hard drives? Partitioning a hard drive will create a space or location within the computers memory that the operating system can address and point to. Formatting a disk creates a file system in which the computers OS can address and use to allocate data, files and applications to different parts of the computer. NFS (Network File Systems) is a computer protocol which enables access to a network and the containing files it possesses, very much like the way in which a computer can access local storage on the same device.

                <br>
                <div class="scroll"><h6>Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) is the ‘original’ protocol for
                    data encryption which was developed for wireless networks, intended to provide similar
                    levels of security as wired network - although it is known to be difficult to configure
                    and have significant security issues. Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA) superseded WEP during
                    the development of the 802.11i wireless security standard in 2003, WPA uses both pre-shared
                    keys (PSK) and Temporal Key Integrity Protocol (TKIP) to carry out data encryption. WPA2 is
                    based on the finalised 802.11i security standard, the use of pre-shared keys with Advanced Encryption
                    Standards (AES) is what sets WPA2 apart from WPA - a set of standards which are used in the most current iterations.
                    Authentication provides a network with a control system in which levels of access can be determined, higher levels of
                    access will be unavailable for users of a low level - whereas some access levels can simply be a user logging in.
                    Digital Certificates allow for entities on a network to be individually identified and marked as known. Encryption
                    is a security measure for the sending and receipt (transmission) of data over the Internet, it enforces confidentiality
                    as it is not readable to someone without a specific key - solely intended for a certain recipient. Encryption also enforces
                    integrity as when encrypted data packets are sent they are ‘hashed’, which means that if they are altered before they reach
                    their destination, they cannot be decrypted. Enforcement of non-repudiation with regards to encryption is carried out as the
                    encryption key corresponds directly to the person who has sent it e.g. created using the senders information. Firewalls assist
                    in monitoring computer networks in terms of inbound and outbound requests, if a Firewall locates something attempting to access
                    the network with intent to damage of the entity is unrecognised - it will throw up a flag to the user. A computer virus is a
                    program created to cause harm or carry out fraudulent activity, most viruses are capable of copying themselves and often are designed
                    to gain access to a system, hide and have detrimental effects such as corrupting files. Upon receiving emails containing unfamiliar
                    attachments or mail contents a user should ensure they do not further explore the attachment, as it could be some for of malware or
                    virus intending to corrupt your computer system, all computers should be kept up-to-date with current OS and security patches, have
                    anti-virus software and a Firewall in use.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Users should always think before opening unrecognised attachments or visiting suspicious
                    webpages, use passwords which are not easily guessed or hacked and deter from using open Wi-Fi networks, scan using AV Software, confirm
                    attachments with the sender and delete suspicious emails from inbox. Patches and updates in client software are used to fix errors discovers
                    by users or the development team/developer of the software, a ‘patch’ quite literally will add certain aspects to a piece of software which
                    were previously lacking. When an attack is suspected, a user should immediately disconnect from the Internet or LAN network, use anti-virus/malware
                    software to detect malicious intrusions, remove infected files and check other devices which are connected to the network in the case of them being
                    infected also, backups of data should be made. A virus multiples itself as much as possible and attached to host files which, when moved, copied or
                    sent elsewhere, the virus will go too. A worm infects a device with no need for a host file, and can multiply and reiterate itself through a system
                    or group of systems without the need for human interaction. Spyware is software that was solely created and implemented in order to gain information
                    about someone or business, infecting a computer like a virus and lying dormant as it avoids detection, often sending information to another location
                    so that it can be collected and used by creators to carry out fraudulent or criminal activity.Whilst using the Internet users should ensure at all times
                    they are remaining aware and vigilant of the sites, tabs and emails or attachments that they open or share with others, 'Adware' and 'Spyware' are sometimes
                    very hard to remove and even by simply opening an unfamiliar, suspicious email attachment can cause privacy and security concerns for anyone using the Internet.

                    <br>
                    When in the workplace, or at home - we all enjoy browsing the Web, surfing to our favourite sites and enjoying the modern threshold that is social media, but more
                    often than not, there are users of company system which are mistaken when thinking it is always safe to connect ones personal device directly into a company network
                    without having taken any precautions or followed security procedures in order to ensure the well-being of the network and the companies data/applications.
                    Along with this, it is surprising that online copyrighting and pirating still exists, but plays a massive role in todays Internet and for anything with definitive
                    ownership attached to it, the law states that the original creator of a piece of work should have the utmost rights in its use and/or distribution, so in the case of
                    someone who is not the original creator, using or distributing it would be against the law under the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988. Data encryption plays a
                    major role in the security maintenance of company transmissions and allows organisations to safely transmit information and hold secure communications without causes
                    for concern regarding interceptions. Different companies have different policies that have been detailed to define their own personal guidelines to the creation and
                    transmission of encrypted data, files or information - sometimes limiting distribution encryption keys or access to algorithms throughout the company to prevent
                    unauthorised disclosure and/or subsequent fraudulent use of transmitted information. The “Right to be Forgotten” ruling is somewhat of a controversial policy available
                    to users whom, for varying reasons may wish for some data or Internet property about themselves or related to themselves to be removed/deleted when it is ‘no longer necessary’.
                    The right to have your data removed is not always absolute, and sometimes can be contested due to the fact that the information is necessary for something else, is related
                    to something else or has some purpose to a company or other individual with access to it, requests for erasure are handled on a case-by-case basis and are evaluated and is
                    decided on the concept that data storage of personal information is no longer needed or the purpose for which the data was collected is no longer relevant. Possible
                    ramifications of damaging information on the Internet are clear as information which an individual would like to destroy could well be relevant or necessary to an organisation
                    and may be challenged in order to prevent its destruction or erasure.

                        dynamic effects and features within Webpages. JavaScript is a client-side scripting language which means it solely resides within a web page, and is interpreted
                        and executed within a browser. JavaScript doesn’t require any plug-in installations to use it, unlike the likes of Flash - in which a plug-in is required. It is
                        embedded within HTML code and utilises the DOM (Document Object Model) which uses objects to control aspects of the browser. In JS there are a series of data types;
                        String, Number, Boolean, Undefined and Null, along with that of objects, objects are the most complex of the set as they are said to be ‘mutable’ - meaning that
                        they can be changed by a user/programmer, the rest of the data types are immutable and cannot be changed or altered and are primitively defined. An object is derived
                        from a range of ‘properties’ within JavaScript and properties are defined by the association of a name and a value together - if a properties value is a function,
                        it is called a ‘method’. JS methods are functions which are stored as object properties, for eg. defining ‘objectName( ).methodName( )’ in code would accurately
                        represent objects with regards to methods. JavaScript was initially released in 1996 on Netscape Navigator and Internet Explorer, ever since it has been upgraded
                        and reiterated into newer versions to allow for new capabilities and to accommodate different browsers or web services. In 2005, JavaScript Version 1.6 was released
                        which was the equivalent to ECMAScript for XML features, the most recent versions have been reiterations of version 1.8 which are now available on Mozilla Firefox
                        and Google Chrome as well as Netscape Navigator and Internet Explorer. In JavaScript some applications can run on the server-side of a client-side system, these
                        are called server-side applications and they are created and run on the Web server, whereas client-side applications are handled by the client - a browser.
                        There are a wide range of coding practices a developer must know before beginning to program using JavaScript, making declarations of variables at the top of the document,
                        initialising them when they are declared, using ‘===‘ comparison operators instead of ‘==‘ as ‘==‘ will always convert the two variables to matching data types,
                        use code comments using ‘/*’ to ensure certain sections are labelled and given a brief description. In many programming languages both addition and concatenation are
                        commonly mistaken for one another, addition is the use of a ‘+’ symbol in order to add two numeric values, concatenation on the other hand is the joining of two of
                        more String values within a block of code. In JavaScript however, it is frowned upon to use a ‘+’ symbol in order to concatenate and in fact a method called ‘concat( )’
                        can be used in order to join two Strings instead. Global variables in JavaScript are defined when declared outside of a function, meaning all scripts and other functions
                        within the code can access. A local variable is one that is declared within a function or is passed to a function, meaning if a variable is declared within a function
                        it can only be used within that function.

            <h6>
                Relational databases were invented in 1970 by IBM and are defined as groupings of data items which have relations to each other, contained in tables, rows and columns.
                Relational databases are in support of Automicity, Consistency, Isolation and Durability (ACID), which is a structure that ensures the correct and reliable process of
                transactions within a database. Non-relational databases or NoSQL databases are involved in the handling and scaling of large quantities of unstructured data, eliminating
                ‘referential integrity’ - a relational database concept which enforces that all relationships regarding tables and data must be consistent. In any non-relational database model
                relationships are a very important aspect, they help to eliminate data redundancy and allow for a more concise and usable database. There are different types of relationships between
                tables and data within databases, one-to-one, one-to-many and many-to-many; each type defines its own form of relationship between different tables - e.g. one-to-many could be a teacher
                within a class of students, as there is one teacher and ‘many’ or multiple students. SQL or Structured Query Language is used within databases to pose ‘queries’ to them, communicate with
                aspects of the databases and to perform tasks such as retrieving data from a table or updating a tables records. MySQL is the database vendor I am most familiar with, but there are also
                Microsoft SQL Servers for databases along with Oracle and IBM DB2.

            <h6>A browser is responsible for protecting a computer from use of client-side JavaScript or XSS injection, this is called cross-site scripting.
                A computers operating system will be in control of anti-virus software programs and/or or Firewall, allowing it to protect against harmful programs.
                Signed scripts are ones that contain a ‘digital signature’ which in turn request more privileges than if they weren’t signed, the signature allows users
                to ensure that their script hasn’t been changed or tampered with since the time it was originally signed. Attackers using XSS to target a victim don’t target
                the hosts computer directly and instead inject a piece of malicious code into a vulnerable part of a webpage in order to deliver harmful script inputs of unvalidated
                code to a hosts computer. XSS can be used is ActiveX and Flash as well as JavaScript although it is the most targeted as it is essential in most browsers for web projection.
                A cookie is a small file that allows for web pages to recognise your computer either temporarily or permanently, they can be used to keep the likes of log in details relevant to
                a specific user or to track a users preferences.

            <br>
            <h6>In Javascript there are several ways in which you can load and use scripts and external libraries within your code, firstly one must locate the resource they wish to incorporate
                to their project which means either downloading it as a file or including a specific URL to the code in incorporate the scripts. Referencing a library on your webpage is simple
                in that the external library should be listed with ‘script’ tags within the ‘head’ section of an HTML document. When the external scripts have been referenced they can be initialised
                and event handlers can be used in order to call specific scripts within the code. The ‘XMLHttpRequest’ (XHR) object is an API which contains methods that assist in the communication
                between a browser and a web server - which is used heavily in AJAX programming. The object interacts with XML code using a ‘responseXML’ method, that it can use to retrieve structured
                data by parsing the XML. AJAX makes requests to a web server from a users browser by running a JavaScript function which then creates a XMLHttpRequest, the request is sent to the web
                server with use of either a HTTP ‘POST’ or ‘GET’; which either supply additional data from the client browser or request for the inclusion of all data within a URL, respectively.
                The web server then processes the request, generates a response and sends it back to the browser, JavaScript then parses the server response and the webpage can be updated accordingly
                without the need for a page refresh or reload. Alternatives to using XML-based AJAX responses come in the form of SSE or Server-Sent Events, which perform very similar actions to that
                of XMLHttpRequests as they allow a web page to automatically update from a remote server without refreshing it. When attempting to parse XML responses from AJAX requests there are certain
                XML structures that must be followed; XML demands that there must be a declaration along with a MIME type of ‘text/xml’, they are also limited to a specific size value meaning any
                responses that are sent back to web browsers are also of a limited size.

        <div class="scroll"><h6>A URI or Uniform Resource Identifier is a string of characters used to uniquely identify a resource, a very common URI is the Uniform Resource Locator (URL) which is the location of a resource. A URN is a Uniform Resource Name which is used to provide a mechanism for identification of resources by defining specific namespaces. Commonly, most computers have a built in pop-up blocker, although there are third party software programs available that may target different types of pop-ups or advertising. TLS or Transfer Layer Security is a public key encryption protocol which was superseded by SSL, an acronym for Secure Sockets Layer. PCT or Private Communications Transport protocol is also based on the encryption and transmission of public keys. The Internet is a global computer network comprised of interconnected networks which are publicly accessible, an Intranet on the other hand is a closed or private system of resources which are specifically only available to a single network - often used in schools or other professional bodies which may require such private networking services. An extranet is a webpage which gives the likes of company associates or related organisations to access certain resources, often a subset of the resources that are available from a company’s Intranet. With relevance to it’s uses for businesses and thriving organisations the world wide web and associated web clients are useful with regards to the fact that information can be transmitted with ease, information transmission within business is especially important as it can range from the transfer of company operations to it’s financial standing or stocks, meaning important information can be shared and monitored in a more efficient manner than to use another medium such as paperwork. Using different web browsers can be both advantageous to a user or the opposite, depending on what it is the user wishes to carry out with use of the browser; for example, using a very fast browser that processes web based information very quickly, may be more detrimental to a user who would prefer rich content to be displayed. Some browsers will be riddled with functionality elements allowing for a user to do more with the browser, although this can be a drawback with regards to cross platform compatibility as some browsers will have predefined solutions in their infrastructure which are not supported by other browsing software packages, therefore disabling them from being used in a cross or multi-platform scenario. The function of CAPTCHA on the Internet is to test and verify if a user is a human or a computerised robot attempting to gain unauthorised access to a set of resources, the test currently embodies a set of letters which are distorted and/or blurred out slightly - the reason for this is that humans can distinguish the letters from each other and enter them correctly, whereas current computer programs cannot. Anonymous browsing on the Internet is when a user creates an ‘anonymous’ or private window within their browser where their personal information, browsing history, downloads or bookmarks are saved the computer and are completely erased upon the browsing software or private window session being closed - it is purely for security reasons and in the case of a user wishing for their web browsing to be entirely confidential.

Web Analysts use web based analytics to troubleshoot an organisations site and make plans in order to update the website. A website manager ensures website functionality remains as it was intended and performs software updates to the website, along with monitoring and reporting performance. A DBA or database administrator ensures performance of a database by considering security and database integrity. A server administrator’s job is to monitor and manage the performance of a server within a business in order to ensure there is no server ‘down-time’ or problems within the server. A help desk technician ensures that a company’s technological services up-to-date and running at optimal performance levels. Web marketing managers are responsible for implementing marketing strategics to assist company growth and income. A mobile web application developer is someone who creates web applications that are suited and tailored for mobile usage, writing processes and programs which make up a web-based mobile application that can be used on mobile devices easily. A PC and mobile repair technician is a job which entails a person who repairs and maintains computers and mobile devices to ensure they are working correctly, configuring new hardware devices and upgrading software applications.

    A web developer is someone who can program web applications and use programming languages to assist in their creation e.g. HTML/CSS/JavaScript/jQuery/PHP/SQL etc., whereas a web architect still can program but are more involved in overall system design and designing or implementing frameworks - which can then be passed on to a development team. A security analyst is a person whose job is to diagnose security issues, allocating security procedures and upgrading security plans for the company - along with recommending new security options that the company could use for their systems, on the other hand, a security manager’s job is involved in daily maintenance of a system, reporting performance issues and providing feedback to assist in future system plans. A CEO is an overall manager of a company with responsibilities is fields such as implementing plans for business strategies and carrying out company processes by taking tasks from a board of directors, a COO on the other hand is a person in charge of more so, “day-to-day” operations of a company and allocating work-loads to specific departments of the company, often reporting to the CEO as somewhat of an assistant in an organisation.

        <div class="scroll"><h6>HTML used to be SGML which stands for Standard Generalised Markup Language, Markup Language has since progressed to contain “HTML Tags”, other languages such as XML were also based primarily on SGML, although since it has been made obsolete due to the introduction of HTML. The latest version of HTML is currently HTML 5 that still uses a lot of the same features included in the original specification but now with lots of new features and functionality. HTML 2.0 was the first official specification of HTML, introduced in 1995, since then versions of note are versions like HTML 3.2 and HTML 4.01. The HTML Document Object Model (DOM) is a system that adds structure to HTML documents and allows browsers to project them into viewable and usable webpages, it is based on tags which are separated into a hierarchy elements - which can be referenced using JavaScript to alter them without refreshing the webpage, this is called Dynamic HTML. The W3C standard for consistency in web development is very important in that when pages are designed and created by a developer they can omit vital documentation or document structure which may in turn assist a web search engine define the webpage from a search performed by a user willing to find the page. All browsers attempt to adhere to the W3C standards in order to optimise page rendering and load times/speeds. Applications can be created/programmed to be rendered within a web browser (web application) displayed on the Internet, divisions, tables and paragraphs can be used along with navigation elements - buttons with hyperlinks/anchors and forms can be used for data submission to the site. A validator can be used to check accessibility compliance with regards to government and industry. Some employers adopt their own standards for webpage design, which is uniquely their own approach on how they like things to be done and maintaining consistency and integrity throughout their designs and developments, lots of employers use external libraries such as Bootstrap or Material Design and often employ a strict design scheme in which somewhat of a webpage template can be made to assist in the reinforcement of their standards. Extensible Markup Language or XML defines rules for formatting documents in which are both human and machine readable, it uses a hierarchy infrastructure system in order to allow the quick parsing and retrieval of data.

            Main formats for graphical images are JPEG, PNG, GIF and SVG, the JPEG format is known as a ‘lossy’ format meaning when rendered it can lose some of an images original quality due to compression, although it has a very large colour palette and can display very colour-rich images. PNG is defined into two types which are PNG-8 and PNG-24, both being entirely lossless formats even after file compression, making it a hot choice for graphic designers to use in professional environments as it doesn’t allow for any loss of quality - the difference between the two being that PNG-24 is a lot more sophisticated with a much larger colour palette, whereas PNG-8 has a small colour palette, it was originally introduced to replace GIF images. GIF is also a lossless format for images, it supports image animations, transparency and image replacement. SVG is an XML-based vector format which allows for two dimensional images to be created with support for animation and interactivity, they are defined entirely in XML text format of text files.

            Raster images create graphics using pixels on a screen or display, vector based images are created using lines which can be drawn between coordinates, often these images are found to include transparency for example, a blank background so that an image can be displayed without a background. You can create images in lots of ways, firstly one needs to acquire a graphical editor in which images can be loaded changed and saved, anything from the simplest of packages like MS Paint to Adobe Photoshop. A user needs to load a new image into the editor or create a new blank one, using tools provided within the package to carry out creative expressions to the image - once it is created it can be saved and displayed somewhere such as a text document or a personal webpage. Stock photography is used by lots of people around the world for the simple fact the images are usually of high quality, readily available and depict scenarios in which a company may wish to display on their own medium, such as a website or database service. Stock images are generic in a sense that they appeal to a broad scope of customers, one downside is that they can be expensive and some companies prefer to take amateur images to use as they are far cheaper to create and can be made to a high degree of relevance to the company or brand they are representing, whereas stock images as stated are generic and are used by hundreds of businesses already. Image and portfolio management is very important in web design, all images of format PNG for example could be placed within an ‘img’ folder within embedded ‘png’ folder in order to systematically store them along with files of the same type and increase efficiency in storage. The browser-safe colour palette is a standardised 216 colours across platforms such as PC or Mac and browsers such as Internet Explorer, Safari and Google Chrome. Each OS has a reserved 40 colours that are significant to that OS itself, totalling 256 web colours for use with webpages, images or web elements. Colour can bare a significant meaning depending on what colour it is, and what colours that surround it or are associated with it - colours are powerful and do indeed have a psychological effect when used together in the right ways, for example the colour blue is known to be representative of loneliness, worry or someone being “blue”, but intact on a webpage the colour blue can promote a feeling of comfort, friendliness and familiarity. Sometimes colours can mix together and form something to a viewer that is unwanted such as a bad matching of two or more colours that don’t go together or using colours which make webpages difficult to read or navigate.

            CSS documentation uses identifiers as a structure by using class names, tag names or id’s - which like functions or methods in other languages use curly brackets that contain element styling codes in order to alter the appearance of html elements, CSS also uses colons and semi-colons in order to structure the documents that are created, e.g. semi-colon will close a CSS property. Inline CSS is when styles are used within HTML code and is added as the value to the “style” attribute”, commonly known as a less efficient manner in which to incorporate CSS elements into an HTML web document. Embedded styles are when the CSS “style” tags are created within the HTML code and any styles the user wishes to uses feature inside the tags and are “embedded”, as such. Link CSS is when the stylesheet is stored in a separate location to the current document and can be “linked” within the page and referenced where needed with use of tag names, class names or identifiers. It is a very different job to create a functional, responsive website for mobile devices than it is for use on a computer, reasons for this are that mobile devices are far smaller than the displays that would display a webpage on a computer screen, so scalability is a thought here - with the amount of time needed in order to carry out the same task (creating a webpage) for a mobile device, increases heavily along with an the complexity of its development. Mobile devices can have very different display specifications which makes it a laborious task to cater to each and every one of them and ensuring the webpage can be viewed as it was intended on all kinds, shapes and sizes of device.

Boolean Operators differ depending on how they are applied in either an IT or engineering respect, with thoughts towards their use in Logic Gates or as they vary throughout programming languages to a certain degree. They can also be used within search engines and as stated allow for inclusion, decision making and exclusion of search elements e.g. searching Dogs OR Cats in Google’s search engine will return search results containing keywords either Dogs or Cats - the plus sign (+) was removed from Google’s search interface as Google + was introduced, it was realised that the operator might interfere with Google’s plus sign service brand during searches, instead quotation marks can be used such as [dogs “cats”], in order to use a Boolean AND operator within the search bar. Keywords are important as they define relevance to a users search such as the topic or content of a webpage, assisting in allowing users to find content on the Internet consistent with their desired search. A search site is the webpage in which Internet searches are performed e.g. Google or Yahoo, a Web Portal or Information Portal is designed specifically to find and bring coherent search items and information together in a manner of uniformity, retrieving sources relevant to a user’s search e.g. YouTube. A Metasearch engine, also known as an ‘aggregator’ is a search tool which allows results from other search engines to be compiled and poses queries to them in order to refine search criteria over a broad range of resources e.g. a metasearch engine could use Google, Bing and Yahoo to refine a search - search engines define a ranking system which is often based on a sources popularity, metasearch engines can abide by another search engines ranking system and depend on the algorithms that are in place in order to find the most suitable results, with the capability to forward queries to multiple third party search engines a metasearch engine can receive far more results from one search than simply using one search engine at a time.

                A ‘spider’ is a computer program which is designed to automatically find, extract and index information from certain websites and web pages to return to the search engine, using available hypertext links to navigate through sites spiders create an ‘index’ of each page on a website and can span to other sites via external links, whilst also being capable of logging change and alterations to specific web pages so that search facilities remain up-to-date, often the more incoming links a page has the higher it is ranked within the search engines index. Authoritative Peer reviewing is the case of a significant body or group of individuals who have been selected in order to provide qualified feedback about a piece of work, often done anonymously. Open Peer reviewing differs from that of authoritative peer reviewing in that it is carried out over a wide range of peers; often colleagues, in which feedback is freely available. A primary resource is when information is directly observed by the user of the resource in first-hand, a secondary resource is the likes of analysis and reports, a users interpretation of a primary resource, indexes; also known as tertiary resources are pieces of documentation relating to the whereabouts of primary and secondary resources. Cookies allow a user to maintain continuity to their browsing experience, personalising their browser so that when they are the one using it passwords and log in details can be saved and less verification is required; this is an advantage, users also have the option to disable cookies - if they are not required. With regards to the first advantage, some users may not wish to have certain data stored using cookies, if they don’t disable the use of cookies or are unaware of how to do so some of their information may be stored without them wishing for it to be, this is a disadvantage. Cookies are stored as small text files which makes them very insecure and easily manipulated. The act of ‘caching’ in computing is the temporary storage in a computers memory of recently used or accessed data, making for faster retrieval of resources which are stored in cache memory. Caching can be performed on a computers memory or to a remote server, however; if a resource is altered or changed and the cached version is not updated, a user may find themselves using the out-of-date version in cache memory rather than the most up-to-date version that has been recently changed.

                When configuring a computers desktop, proxy configuration can be set up within the setting of an OS, allowing for all communications to be routed through that of the proxy server the users selects. The proxy server can then be in control of caching all requests, if a request is repeated then it only needs to access the proxy server in order to obtain the information. Scheduling with regards to calendars and scheduling software allows for projects to be tracked and notifications prompted to users or a development team to indicate which action needs to be undertaken or upcoming events they should be aware of. Personal Information Management (PIM) is a form of application software which is designed to assist users in personal organisation and management, for example Microsoft Outlook or Google Calendar can be considered common pieces of PIM software. Peer-to-Peer (P2P) is a type of networking service which allows for one or more end users to form direct connections between each other, pairing is usually equally privileged and do not require any form server in order to transfer data packets. Networks are used for all manners of communication over the Internet be it locally or from a remote location, meaning that most data being transferred, requested or delivered is being saved and stored to the server the communication is taking place within. If some information that is being stored to the server is not encrypted, it can be accessed and understood freely by anyone with access to that server/network or data pool - flagging a major privacy concern for those who wish not for their communication transmissions to fall into the wrong hands. SMS or Short Message Service is how we send most of our day-to-day text messages, depending on their length and content; SMS is a multi-platform service which allows short messages to be sent and received quickly and efficiently to a desired recipient(s). SMS restricts the number of characters it can handle to 160, meaning anything over this value will be sent as separate messages and most likely take the form of MMS. Mass emailing or texting services are used widely as they are an efficient way in which to send a large volume of messages either via email or text message to a wide range of recipients/devices from an individual, these may be simply a family member reminding a large family about a meeting time or location, or for example a newsletter sent to tens of thousands of subscribed users from a certain website.

                <div class="scroll"><h6>MIME or Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions is a standardised extension to the original Internet mailing protocol that allows for custom text characters sets to be used (other than ASCII), along with non-text attachments such as images, video, audio and applications. S/MIME is a standardised public key encryption service which orchestrates the signing of MIME data and information. PGP or Pretty Good Privacy is an encryption service which uses services such as data compression and public key cryptography, now formalised as OpenPGP standard. GPG or GNU Privacy Guard is a free implementation or replacement for that of PGP/OpenPGP cryptographic software service which allows for use of versatile key management systems and public key directories. Email signatures are useful in a business setting as signatures are a good way of providing validity and verifying identity to other users, rather than unsigned emails which may be perceived as malicious or go unrecognised. Email threads are useful for when a user would like to rehash and read over previous emails sent and received from a particular user incase they forget the topic, or the content they should be sending. Blind copying is when a user disables other users to see the BCC section of an email which reveals the other participants. Forwarding an email is simply copying a previously sent or received email and sending it on as it is to a desired audience, whereas replying is receiving an email and forming an entirely new email in ‘reply’ to the one a user received. Email can be used to address certain workers within a company of a meeting set for a specific time, sent from the CEO down to everyone within one workplace, the email could be addressed formally and have details and content in a professional layout with enough spacing, along with an email signature verification of the email sender. Issues can arise with regards to email signature, if a user does not have an email signature another user may not open their email due to the fact they may think it’s malicious or don’t recognise the sender, therefore the email won’t be opened and no communication undertaken. Concerns for web-based emails and IMAP/POP3 emailing methods are that over a remote server there is no guarantee the information or data packets won’t be intercepted whilst being sent from server to server, rather than being locally sent on the same network service. Texting is seen to be as a far less formal manner of communication than that of sending emails within the workplace, so texting could be used to contact certain friends about plans after work has finished, whereas email could be used for formal business related matters which require professionalism.

                        <div class="scroll"><h6>
                            Project management is a term used to describe the process of planning, designing, executing, testing and maintaining a project during development - it allows for a team to work together to structure a management process in which a project can be successfully finished and the outcome be as it was intended. The project triangle is a consideration of the cost, time and scope of a project, which in turn each effect one another during the course of a projects development. A needs analysis is a produced in project management and proposed to a client in order to gain more detailed requirements, often captured in the form of personal interviews, data analytics and business/company financial checks/reports. The ‘scope’ of a project is all of the components of work that need to be done to complete the projects requirements, if a client poses new ideas to the development team that aren’t listed within the projects requirements they are said to be ‘out of scope’. The scope ‘creep’ is a term used to describe when these additional ideas and concepts requested by the user are developed without the team addressing the requirements. In project development and management differing roles and forms of expertise are required in the case that most product management teams consist of a project manager, lead developer, software engineer, systems analyst and more. Combining as a team and each contributing their own unique and specialised body of knowledge and opinions, project management teams can efficiently divide workloads between dedicated groups during the development stage making the process more efficient and ensuring high quality results. Information flow models describe the transmission of information across a project visually, so that each stage of information transfer is noted and visible , allowing for a better understanding of where information is coming from, going to and what is being transferred. IT project teams often report to upper management within a company to enable them to make informed business and project related decisions, often via personal emailing to and from project team members to upper management secretaries and weekly/monthly reports of progress. A statement of work is a document produced by a project management team to concisely note each stage of work which has been projected within the scope of a project. SOW template standardisation allows for sections of the statement to be easily referenced. Even if a project is entirely technically sound and has followed the projected requirements, it may be affected by social or practical implications in the manner of a client losing interest and dropping the project or if workloads are unrealistic. Documenting a project is very important in project management as it allows more effective planning and monitoring of the project, documentation is also very useful in reviewing, when a project is review it is judged against its projected requirements and requirements met, along with areas of improvement. Technical concerns can translate into business concerns in something as simple as if a new member of staff has not yet been assigned a business email address which possess concerns such as limited business communication and information security. Quality management and assurance helps provide customers with high quality products which function as they were intended, providing a high quality service to customers is crucial in business as without the satisfaction of the client/customer the business would fail. Return on Investment (ROI) is a formula used to determine the profitability of a company making investments for IT-based resources, it is often calculated as a percentage (total profit / investment cost), meaning that if the profit outweighs the costs for investment the company has made good progress in relation to their budget - as using expenses within the budget to make profit for the company is a positive concept. In project management and development it is important for risk evaluation before a project has begun its development cycle as problems may arise during development which prove detrimental to the entire project.</div>
